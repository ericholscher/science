My science bits, mostly copied from: http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~culler/chaos/

Inspired by the book Chaos: Making a New Science: http://www.around.com/chaos.html

Install::

    mkvirtualenv science
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python koch.py
    python -i orbit.py

``basic.py`` requires matplotlib, and is different playing I've been doing.
